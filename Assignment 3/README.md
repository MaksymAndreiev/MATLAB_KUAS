# Assignment No. 3

The following figure shows three circles, with radii 𝑅 1 , 𝑅 2 & 𝑅 3 of 15 cm,10.5 cm, and 4.5 cm,
respectively. A triangle was drawn among their centers.

Create MATLAB Live Script that includes 2 sections (Text section & Code Section)
as shown in the following image.

## In the text Section:

(a) Write the text "Triangle Live Script" as Title.

(b) Insert the image "Assignment_03_Figure.png".\
    Note: The image is in the attachment of assignment 3.

(c) Write the text "Law of cosines" as Heading 1.

(d) Write the following Equation\
$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(y)$$

## In the Code Section

(e) Define the circles’ radii (𝑅 1 , 𝑅 2 & 𝑅 3 ) as variables.

(f) Calculate the triangle sides a, b & c.

(g) Calculate the angle (γ) (in degrees) by using the law of cosines.

(Law of cosines: $\gamma = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}\right)$

(h) Calculate the round of angle (γ) to the nearest integer value.
